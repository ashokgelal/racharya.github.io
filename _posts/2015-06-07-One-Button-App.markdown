I've just graduated from [Boise State University][1] with a degree in [Electrical Engineering][4]. As I wait for the results of my couple of job interviews, I've decided to do some mobile development. I've always been interested in programming and have taken few programming classes at BSU such as Java I, Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, and System Programming in C. Not only I wanted to do more, I also always wanted to make some "real" apps; you know with all the UI, database, backend etc.

A friend of mine suggested to start with the excellent iOS tutorials by [RayWenderlich Site][2]. So I began with [iOS Apprentice Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-apprentice) 1 and so far I have successfully completed building and running the starter **One Button App**. This app is really a *Hello, World!* of iOS app with just one button that pops up an alert with a title and a message. However, despite of its simplicity, I've already learned a lot. The tutorials are excellent and are really written for beginners. I've been told that the tutorials get complex and more interesting. Also, the tutorials are written in [Swift Language][3] and I'm really excited about to learn it as I'm following the tutorials. So far Swift hasn't been a problem and I'm really enjoying it. Honestly, the first time I heard and saw Objective-C, I freaked out a little and thought I'd be never be able to grok it. Thankfully, I never have to learn it.
  
As I said earlier building and running this app was very straightforward. One minor challenge I came across was getting the iOS simulator screen size look the same as in the book. I was getting a big size window whereas the book had the one that looked exactly like an iPhone. Nothing was mentioned in the book on how to fix this issue. I explored different drop down menu looking for something that would help me fix it. So then I came across `simulator--->Window--->Scale` and change the scale to 50%. After fixing the scale, the simulator size was the same size as shown in book and my first iOS app looked good.
