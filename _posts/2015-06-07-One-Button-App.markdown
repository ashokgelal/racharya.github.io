I am following iOS Apprentice Tutorial 1 and I have successfully completed building and running the One Button App. I am no expert in swift but that wasn't an issue here.
  
Building and running this app was very straightforward. One minor challenge I came across was getting the iOS simulator screen size exactly as shown in book. I was getting a big size window whereas the book had the one that looked exactly like an iPhone. Nothing was mentioned in the book on how to fix this issue. So to fix this issue I had to go to the simulator---> Window---> Scale and change the scale to 50%. After fixing this and following the book to build the One Button App, this is what my One Button App looks like.
